Reverse 4 is a web app game. It is similar to Connect 4, however pieces are pushed in from the bottom rather than falling from the top. When a piece is pushed, the entire column is shifted upwards.

Possible modes:
1-player PvE
2-player PvP
lockout mode (after max shifts, row is locked) (default)
endless mode (no max shifts, extra tiles fall out of view)
tie breaking
start game
new game

Components:
Tile (a single space on the game board, can be controlled by either player or neutral)
Board (the game board, contains 42 tiles in a 6x7 area)
gameButton (input buttons that dictate which column to shift)
